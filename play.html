    <h3>A Woman of no Importance </h3>
    <h4>The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_.  _Door at back leading on to
        terrace_.</h4>

        <p>[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
            sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
            knew she would come round in the end.
            
            GERALD.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
            she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
            perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
            couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
            whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
            not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.
            
            GERALD.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on
            your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing
            like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in
            life’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom
            waiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
            like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
            wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
            the community.
            
            GERALD.  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.
            
            GERALD.  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.
            
            GERALD.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
            I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts
            his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,
            I suppose, Gerald?
            
            GERALD.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such
            a mother as I have had.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that
            most mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,
            that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
            After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such
            a hole as Wrockley, could you?
            
            GERALD.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is
            often curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in
            it.
            
            GERALD.  [_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good
            women have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their
            interests are so petty, aren’t they?
            
            GERALD.  They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care
            much about.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort
            of thing.
            
            GERALD.  Oh, yes, she’s always going to church.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only
            thing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?
            You want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put off with any
            old-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present
            is simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a
            London dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the
            dandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.
            
            GERALD.  I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always
            been told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that
            they don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  By the way,
            Gerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.  Sentiment is all
            very well for the button-hole.  But the essential thing for a necktie is
            style.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.
            
            GERALD.  [_Laughing_.]  I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord
            Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know
            how to talk.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to
            every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you
            will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.
            
            GERALD.  But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either
            to feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!
            
            GERALD.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it
            simply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real
            success in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule
            society.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You
            might just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at
            once.
            
            GERALD.  It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You should never try to understand them.  Women are
            pictures.  Men are problems.  If you want to know what a woman really
            means—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her,
            don’t listen to her.
            
            GERALD.  But women are awfully clever, aren’t they?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always tell them so.  But, to the
            philosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over
            mind—just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.
            
            GERALD.  How then can women have so much power as you say they have?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst form
            of tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the
            strong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.
            
            GERALD.  But haven’t women got a refining influence?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.
            
            GERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.
            
            GERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren’t there?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Far too many.
            
            GERALD.  But do you think women shouldn’t be good?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never tell them so, they’d all become good
            at once.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.  Every woman is a rebel,
            and usually in wild revolt against herself.
            
            GERALD.  You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Men marry because they are tired; women because they
            are curious.  Both are disappointed.
            
            GERALD.  But don’t you think one can be happy when one is married?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Perfectly happy.  But the happiness of a married man,
            my dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.
            
            GERALD.  But if one is in love?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always be in love.  That is the reason one
            should never marry.
            
            GERALD.  Love is a very wonderful thing, isn’t it?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.
            And one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a
            romance.  But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays.
            It is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.  That is the one
            use of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation
            of us Harfords.
            
            GERALD.  Harfords, Lord Illingworth?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is my family name.  You should study the Peerage,
            Gerald.  It is the one book a young man about town should know
            thoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever
            done.  And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new life with me,
            and I want you to know how to live.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _appears on terrace
            behind_.]  For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live
            in it!
            
            [_Enter_ L.C. LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ DR. DAUBENY.]
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  Well, I
            suppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new
            duties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a
            pleasant cigarette.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady
            Hunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I
            suppose I am too old now to learn.  Except from you, dear Archdeacon,
            when you are in your nice pulpit.  But then I always know what you are
            going to say, so I don’t feel alarmed.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah!
            dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.  Come, dear.  [_Enter_ MRS.
            ARBUTHNOT.]  Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord
            Illingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant
            way in which everything has turned out for him.  Let us sit down.  [_They
            sit down_.]  And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn’t she?
            
            THE ARCHDEACON.  She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.
            But the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.  She has not touched
            the tambour frame for nine or ten years.  But she has many other
            amusements.  She is very much interested in her own health.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not?  Now,
            what are you talking about, Lord Illingworth?  Do tell us.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the
            world has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in
            which it has been able to bear them.  And that, consequently, whatever
            the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Now I am quite out of my depth.  I usually am when Lord
            Illingworth says anything.  And the Humane Society is most careless.
            They never rescue me.  I am left to sink.  I have a dim idea, dear Lord
            Illingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I
            always try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.
            And after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner
            is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that quite does for me.  I haven’t a word to say.
            You and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.  We can’t follow Lord
            Illingworth.  Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid.
            To have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.  It shuts one
            out from so much.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of
            his opinions.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  You are quite right, dear.
            
            [GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_.
            _Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  Jane, have you seen John anywhere?
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  You needn’t be anxious about him, dear.  He is with
            Lady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.
            They seem quite happy together.  You are not going, Caroline?  Pray sit
            down.
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  I think I had better look after John.
            
            [_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  It doesn’t do to pay men so much attention.  And
            Caroline has really nothing to be anxious about.  Lady Stutfield is very
            sympathetic.  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about
            another.  A beautiful nature.
            
            [_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]
            
            Ah! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs. Allonby too!  I suppose it was Mrs.
            Allonby I saw him with.  Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere
            for you.
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady
            Hunstanton.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! the Music-room, of course.  I thought it was the
            Yellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.  [_To the_
            ARCHDEACON.]  Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn’t she?
            
            THE ARCHDEACON.  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but
            since her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early
            childhood.  But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great
            pleasure.
            
            [_Enter_ LADY STUTFIELD _and_ MR. KELVIL.]
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been
            talking to you about?
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Bimetallism!  Is that quite a nice subject?  However, I
            know people discuss everything very freely nowadays.  What did Sir John
            talk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  About Patagonia.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a remote topic!  But very improving, I
            have no doubt.
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.
            Savages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost
            all subjects.  They are excessively advanced.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  What do they do?
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  Apparently everything.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it
            not, to find that Human Nature is permanently one.—On the whole, the
            world is the same world, is it not?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The world is simply divided into two classes—those who
            believe the incredible, like the public—and those who do the improbable—
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  Like yourself?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the only
            thing that makes life worth living.
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful
            qualities in my own nature.
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah! don’t become quite perfect all at once.  Do it
            gradually!
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t intend to grow perfect at all.  At least, I
            hope I shan’t.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love us for our
            defects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything,
            even our gigantic intellects.
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.  We forgive
            adoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us.
            
            [_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.  _He joins_ LADY STUTFIELD.]
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn’t we,
            dear Mrs. Arbuthnot?  I am sure you agree with me in that.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many
            things women should never forgive.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  What sort of things?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The ruin of another woman’s life.
            
            [_Moves slowly away to back of stage_.]
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe
            there are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and
            reformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take
            things very, very easily.
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is
            unbecoming.
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of
            being terribly, terribly deceived.
            
            KELVIL.  The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  There is no secret of life.  Life’s aim, if it has
            one, is simply to be always looking for temptations.  There are not
            nearly enough.  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a
            single one.  It is quite dreadful.  It makes one so nervous about the
            future.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Shakes her fan at him_.]  I don’t know how it is,
            dear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me
            excessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to you.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is
            destruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing survives
            being thought of.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But I
            have no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very little to
            reproach myself with, on the score of thinking.  I don’t believe in women
            thinking too much.  Women should think in moderation, as they should do
            all things in moderation.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.  Nothing
            succeeds like excess.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an admirable
            maxim.  But I’m beginning to forget everything.  It’s a great misfortune.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady
            Hunstanton.  No woman should have a memory.  Memory in a woman is the
            beginning of dowdiness.  One can always tell from a woman’s bonnet
            whether she has got a memory or not.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  You
            always find out that one’s most glaring fault is one’s most important
            virtue.  You have the most comforting views of life.
            
            [_Enter_ FARQUHAR.]
            
            FARQUHAR.  Doctor Daubeny’s carriage!
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Archdeacon!  It is only half-past ten.
            
            THE ARCHDEACON.  [_Rising_.]  I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.
            Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny’s bad nights.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  Well, I won’t keep you from her.  [_Goes
            with him towards door_.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of
            partridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.
            
            THE ARCHDEACON.  It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches
            solids now.  Lives entirely on jellies.  But she is wonderfully cheerful,
            wonderfully cheerful.  She has nothing to complain of.
            
            [_Exit with_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Goes over to_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  There is a beautiful
            moon to-night.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Let us go and look at it.  To look at anything that is
            inconstant is charming nowadays.
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  You have your looking-glass.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is unkind.  It merely shows me my wrinkles.
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  Mine is better behaved.  It never tells me the truth.
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then it is in love with you.
            
            [_Exeunt_ SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL _and_ LORD ALFRED.]
            
            GERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH]  May I come too?
            
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do, my dear boy.  [_Moves towards door with_ MRS.
            ALLONBY _and_ GERALD.]
            
            [LADY CAROLINE _enters_, _looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite
            direction to that taken by_ SIR JOHN _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!
            
            GERALD.  What, mother!
            
            [_Exit_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is getting late.  Let us go home.
            
            GERALD.  My dear mother.  Do let us wait a little longer.  Lord
            Illingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great
            surprise for you.  We are starting for India at the end of this month.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let us go home.
            
            GERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid
            good-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I’ll be back in five minutes.
            [_Exit_.]
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him—not
            with him!  I couldn’t bear it.  [_Walks up and down_.]
            
            [_Enter_ HESTER.]
            
            HESTER.  What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Is it?
            
            HESTER.  Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so
            different from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room
            this evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and
            pure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to
            say, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.
            
            HESTER.  I didn’t know you had heard it.  But I knew you would agree with
            me.  A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn’t she?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.
            
            HESTER.  She shouldn’t be allowed to come into the society of good men
            and women?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  She should not.
            
            HESTER.  And the man should be punished in the same way?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are
            children, in the same way also?
            
            HESTER.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited
            on the children.  It is a just law.  It is God’s law.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is one of God’s terrible laws.
            
            [_Moves away to fireplace_.]
            
            HESTER.  You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.
            
            HESTER.  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?  Of course
            there is position, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not
            everything, are they?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  They are nothing; they bring misery.
            
            HESTER.  Then why do you let your son go with him?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He wishes it himself.
            
            HESTER.  But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He has set his heart on going.
            
            HESTER.  He couldn’t refuse you anything.  He loves you too much.  Ask
            him to stay.  Let me send him in to you.  He is on the terrace at this
            moment with Lord Illingworth.  I heard them laughing together as I passed
            through the Music-room.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.  It is of no
            consequence.
            
            HESTER.  No, I’ll tell him you want him.  Do—do ask him to stay.  [_Exit_
            HESTER.]
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He won’t come—I know he won’t come.
            
            [Enter LADY CAROLINE.  _She looks round anxiously_.  _Enter_ GERALD.]
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the
            terrace?
            
            GERALD.  No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  It is very curious.  It is time for him to retire.
            
            [_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]
            
            GERALD.  Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.  I forgot all about
            it.  I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  At the prospect of going away?
            
            GERALD.  Don’t put it like that, mother.  Of course I am sorry to leave
            you.  Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.  But after all, as
            Lord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as
            Wrockley.  You don’t mind it.  But I’m ambitious; I want something more
            than that.  I want to have a career.  I want to do something that will
            make you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help me.  He is
            going to do everything for me.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, don’t go away with Lord Illingworth.  I implore
            you not to.  Gerald, I beg you!
            
            GERALD.  Mother, how changeable you are!  You don’t seem to know your own
            mind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you
            agreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and
            try to force me to give up my one chance in life.  Yes, my one chance.
            You don’t suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every
            day, do you, mother?  It is very strange that when I have had such a
            wonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my
            way should be my own mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester
            Worsley.  Who could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever
            told you, far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I
            could—I could ask her to—Don’t you understand now, mother, what it means
            to me to be Lord Illingworth’s secretary?  To start like that is to find
            a career ready for one—before one—waiting for one.  If I were Lord
            Illingworth’s secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.  As a wretched
            bank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I know
            her views on life.  She has just told them to me.  [_A pause_.]
            
            GERALD.  Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.  That is something—I
            am glad I have that!  You have always tried to crush my ambition,
            mother—haven’t you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place,
            that success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that
            sort of thing—well, I don’t believe it, mother.  I think the world must
            be delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a
            thing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me,
            mother, quite wrong.  Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a
            fashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I
            would give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I would sooner see you dead.
            
            GERALD.  Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?  Tell
            me—tell me right out.  What is it?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is a bad man.
            
            GERALD.  In what way bad?  I don’t understand what you mean.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will tell you.
            
            GERALD.  I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn’t believe the same
            things as you do.  Well, men are different from women, mother.  It is
            natural that they should have different views.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he
            does not believe, that makes him bad.  It is what he is.
            
            GERALD.  Mother, is it something you know of him?  Something you actually
            know?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is something I know.
            
            GERALD.  Something you are quite sure of?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Quite sure of.
            
            GERALD.  How long have you known it?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For twenty years.
            
            GERALD.  Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man’s career?  And
            what have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth’s early life?  What
            business is it of ours?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What this man has been, he is now, and will be always.
            
            GERALD.  Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?  If he did anything
            shameful, I will not go away with him.  Surely you know me well enough
            for that?
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, come near to me.  Quite close to me, as you used
            to do when you were a little boy, when you were mother’s own boy.
            [GERALD _sits down beside his mother_.  _She runs her fingers through his
            hair_, _and strokes his hands_.]  Gerald, there was a girl once, she was
            very young, she was little over eighteen at the time.  George
            Harford—that was Lord Illingworth’s name then—George Harford met her.
            She knew nothing about life.  He—knew everything.  He made this girl love
            him.  He made her love him so much that she left her father’s house with
            him one morning.  She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry
            her!  He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him.
            She was very young, and—and ignorant of what life really is.  But he put
            the marriage off from week to week, and month to month.—She trusted in
            him all the while.  She loved him.—Before her child was born—for she had
            a child—she implored him for the child’s sake to marry her, that the
            child might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child,
            who was innocent.  He refused.  After the child was born she left him,
            taking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and
            all that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also.  She suffered
            terribly—she suffers now.  She will always suffer.  For her there is no
            joy, no peace, no atonement.  She is a woman who drags a chain like a
            guilty thing.  She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a
            leper.  The fire cannot purify her.  The waters cannot quench her
            anguish.  Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies
            forgetfulness!  She is lost!  She is a lost soul!—That is why I call Lord
            Illingworth a bad man.  That is why I don’t want my boy to be with him.
            
            GERALD.  My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course.  But I
            dare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth
            was.—After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings
            at all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married, and
            live with him as his wife?  No nice girl would.
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_After a pause_.]  Gerald, I withdraw all my
            objections.  You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when
            and where you choose.
            
            GERALD.  Dear mother, I knew you wouldn’t stand in my way.  You are the
            best woman God ever made.  And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don’t believe
            he is capable of anything infamous or base.  I can’t believe it of him—I
            can’t.
            
            HESTER.  [_Outside_.]  Let me go!  Let me go!  [_Enter_ HESTER _in
            terror_, _and rushes over to_ GERALD _and flings herself in his arms_.]
            
            HESTER.  Oh! save me—save me from him!
            
            GERALD.  From whom?
            
            HESTER.  He has insulted me!  Horribly insulted me!  Save me!
            
            GERALD.  Who?  Who has dared—?
            
            [LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters at back of stage_.  HESTER _breaks from_
            GERALD’S _arms and points to him_.]
            
            GERALD  [_He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation_.]  Lord
            Illingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God’s earth, a thing
            as pure as my own mother.  You have insulted the woman I love most in the
            world with my own mother.  As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you!
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rushing across and catching hold of him_]  No! no!
            
            GERALD.  [_Thrusting her back_.]  Don’t hold me, mother.  Don’t hold
            me—I’ll kill him!
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!
            
            GERALD.  Let me go, I say!
            
            MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Stop, Gerald, stop!  He is your own father!
            
            [GERALD _clutches his mother’s hands and looks into her face_.  _She
            sinks slowly on the ground in shame_.  HESTER _steals towards the door_.
            LORD ILLINGWORTH _frowns and bites his lip_.  _After a time_ GERALD
            _raises his mother up_, _puts his arm round her_, _and leads her from
            the room_.]
