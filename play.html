    <h4 class="name">The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_.  _Door at back leading on to
        terrace_.</h4>

        <p class="stage_direction">[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
            sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.] </p>
            
            <h5 class="name ILLINGWORTH "> ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p>Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
            knew she would come round in the end.</p>
            
           <h5 class="name GERALD"> GERALD.</h5> <p class=speech> My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
            she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
            perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
            couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.</p>
            
            <h5  class="name ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class=speech>My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
            whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
            not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.</p>
            
            <h5  class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class=speech>But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.</p>
            
            <h5  class="name ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class=speech>Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on
            your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing
            like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in
            life’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom
            waiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
            like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
            wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
            the community.</p>
            
            <h5  class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class=speech>But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?</p>
            
            <h5  class="name ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5> <p class=speech> I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.</p>
            
            <h5  class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class=speech>I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.</p>
            
            <h5  class="name ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class=speech>So Lady Hunstanton told me.</p>
            
            <h5  class="name GERALD"> GERALD.</h5>  <p class=speech>It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
            I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.</p>
            
            <h5  class="name ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class="stage_direction">[_Winces slightly_.]</p>  <p class=speech>Really?</p>  <p class="stage_direction">[_Goes over and puts
            his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]</p>  <p class=speech>You have missed not having a father,
            I suppose, Gerald?</p>
            
            <h5  class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class=speech>Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such
            a mother as I have had.</p>
            
            <h5  class="name ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class=speech>I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that
            most mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,
            that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
            After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such
            a hole as Wrockley, could you?</p>

            <h5  class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class=speech>Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!</p>

            <h5  class="name ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5> <p class=speech> A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is
           often curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in
            it.</p>

            <h5  class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="stage_direction">[_Slowly_.] </p>  <p class=speech> I suppose there is.</p>

            <h5  class="name ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class=speech>Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good
           women have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their
           interests are so petty, aren’t they?</p>

           <h5  class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class=speech>They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care
           much about.</p>

           <h5  class="name ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class=speech>I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort
           of thing.</p>

           <h5  class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class=speech>Oh, yes, she’s always going to church.</p>
