    <h5 class="name ILLINGWORTH ">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5> <p class=speech> Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only
thing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?
You want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put off with any
old-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present
is simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a
London dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the
dandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.</p>

<h5 class="name GERALD ">GERALD.</h5>  <p class=speech>I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always
been told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.</p>

<h5 class="name ILLINGWORTH ">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5> <p class=speech>People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that
they don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  By the way,
Gerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.  Sentiment is all
very well for the button-hole.  But the essential thing for a necktie is
style.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.</p>

<h5 class="name GERALD ">GERALD.</h5> <p class=speech> [_Laughing_.]</p>  <p class=speech> might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord
Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know</p>
how to talk.

<h5 class="name ILLINGWORTH ">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class=speech>Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to
every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you
will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.</p>

<h5 class="name GERALD ">GERALD.</h5>  <p class=speech>But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?</p>

<h5 class="name ILLINGWORTH ">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5> <p class=speech> To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either
to feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!</p>

<h5 class="name GERALD ">GERALD.</h5> <p class=speech> I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!</p>
